# Severn Trent NbS Opportunity Mapping

## Overview
Python-based pipeline for Nature-based Solutions (NbS) opportunity mapping across the Severn Trent operating area. This project translates and extends an existing R-based workflow (originally developed for the Warwickshire Avon under the N4W Facility) into a scalable, API-driven Python pipeline.

## NbS Types Mapped
1. **Pond/Pool/Scrape Creation** — Water retention features in flow pathway areas
2. **Leaky Barriers** — Timber features along waterways within surface water flood risk areas
3. **Bunds / Catchment Storage Areas** — Earth embankments perpendicular to runoff pathways
4. **Floodplain Reconnection & Restoration** — Reconnecting watercourses to floodplains
5. **Riparian Buffer Strips / Restoration** — Planting in riparian areas
6. **Woodland and Tree Planting** — Wider catchment woodland creation

## Methodology
Each NbS type follows a generic approach:
- **Opportunity Data** → identifies where an intervention *could* go
- **Constraints Data** → removes areas where it *shouldn't* go (urban, roads, railways, peat, existing woodland, source protection zones)
- **Supplementary Data** → enriches outputs with priority scoring (agricultural grade, habitat networks, soil type, baseline land use, infiltration class)

Data is sourced via open APIs from DEFRA / Environment Agency / Natural England / Ordnance Survey where possible.

## Data Sources
All datasets are sourced from open data platforms, primarily:
- [DEFRA Data Services Platform](https://environment.data.gov.uk/)
- [OS Open Data](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-zoomstack)
- [CEH Land Cover Maps](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/data/ukceh-land-cover-maps)
- [BGS Soil Parent Material Model](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/datasets/soil-parent-material-model/)

## Original Work
This pipeline extends the methodology developed by Jack Beard (Green in Blue) and Corjan Nolet (FutureWater) for the Nature for Water Facility — Warwickshire Avon project (March 2024).
